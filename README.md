# My-first-website
After learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I want to begin making my first website. Also I believe that practicing in making a website is far better then watching tutorials all day hence the reason for this project.

### What are the contents of my web page?
I will discuss why I think practicing on coding a web page will net you better results then trying to endlessly watch HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tutorials.

### How will this demonstrate my web development skills?
The contents and discussion on my website will be formatted in a way that will demonstrate what I learned so far as a beginner. The page layout and style will express my skills with HTML and CSS, while also including some JavaScript elements such as animations and so on.
